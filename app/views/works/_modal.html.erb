        <p> A writing prompt is a little helping hand to get you started with your writing.</p>
        <p> If you want a writing prompt, you can click the buttons to generate a <i class="fas fa-hat-wizard"></i> fictional prompt or a <i class="far fa-newspaper"></i> non-fictional prompt. Alternatively there are loads of good suggestions on <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/"> reddit</a>.</p>
        <p> Note that after you've generated a prompt, you yourself can edit it... just use them as a very rough guideline! Just be inspired, don't stick rigidly to them. Or do, it's up to you. </p>
        <p> Also remember that writing prompts, particularly the non-fiction ones, often provoke or challenge you. They may not be comfortable. Just click the button again for another one.</p>
        <p> Using the checkbox, you can choose whether the writing prompt is seen by people watching as you write. This is just up to personal preference. I like to hide it so I look like a creative genius. </p>
