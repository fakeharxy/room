        <p> A writing prompt is a little helping hand to get you started with your writing.</p>
        <p> If you want a writing prompt, you can click the button <i class="fas fa-magic"></i> to generate one. Alternatively there are loads of good suggestions on <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/"> reddit</a>.</p>
        <p> Note that after you've generated a prompt, you yourself can edit it... just use them as a very rough guideline! Just be inspired, don't feel you have to stick to them rigidly. </p>
        <p> Also remember that writing prompts often provoke or challenge you. They may not be comfortable. Just click the button again for another one.</p>
        <p> You can also simply use this box as a description, to help your reader orientate themselves. Something like: "Chapter Three of my Centaur based romantic comedy." </p>
        <p> Using the checkbox, you can choose whether the writing prompt is seen by people watching as you write. This is just up to personal preference. I like to hide it so I look like a creative genius. </p>
