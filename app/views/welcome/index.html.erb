    <p> WriteRoom can be used to motivate yourself to write, to watch others hone their craft, or as a demonstrative teaching tool. It's still in its early stages, but why not sign up as a beta user and help shape a unique writing tool? </p>

      <p> Writing is hard. So, so hard. But to get good, you know you have to do it. A lot of it. You have to learn from mistakes. You have to read as well as write. </p>

      <p> I've made a platform that tries to support all of this. First, you create a project, with optional writing prompts to help get the juices flowing...</p>

      <h3 class="heading"> Start writing... </h3>
      <p>Then you fight your demons and start writing! Just do it. Just get going. Nothing bad can happen. In fact, a few good things can! </p>

      <h3 class="heading"> ...and you'll get feedback. </h3>

      <p>But only good feedback! As people watch, they will see you writing in real time and, if they like what they see, can applaude you. It feels good, man.</p>
      <p>Everything you write is immediately saved to the server too, so, in theory, you should never lose a word, no matter how much you write.*</p>

  <p> It has a load of other features that are all mostly working... and with your feedback, should be working excellently shortly. Things like following, DMs, bookmarking a project, zooming to new text as it's written... these things all work. They're just not amazing, yet. Sign up and see! </p>
